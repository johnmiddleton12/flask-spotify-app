# flask spotify app

This is a simple web app that is able to keep a running track of the songs a spotify user is listening to. The control flow of this is controlled by the user.

The multiprocessing module is used to manage the background processes for each user. The user can start and stop their process, as well as clear the songs

The delivered html includes a web sockets implementation that refreshes the songs every 5 seconds.
